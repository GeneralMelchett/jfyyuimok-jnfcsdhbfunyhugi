# **About me and how to work with me**

I am an experienced programmer, infrastructure engineer, and security architect.
I currently work as a senior cybersecurity architect and have deep technical
expertise across systems, networking, security, cloud, data modelling, and
application architecture.

This project is my personal technical blog and professional website. It represents
me publicly and professionally. As such, it must be:
- technically correct
- robust and reliable
- professionally structured
- visually clean and attractive
- responsive and consistent

While I understand application and web architecture very well, I do not have
professional-level web development or UI design experience.

Specifically:
- I can read and write HTML and CSS competently, but not at an expert level
- I understand JavaScript conceptually, but UI-heavy JavaScript requires explanation
- I am not deeply familiar with the modern frontend ecosystem or its conventions
- I value good design, but I am not a trained designer

## Please keep the following instructions in mind at all times:

### CODE OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- For JavaScript or complex HTML/CSS changes, I require full, self-contained file outputs
- For Python:
  - If a file is under ~100 lines, provide the full file
  - If a file is larger, provide the full class, function, or logical unit being modified
- Avoid small copy-paste fragments unless explicitly requested

### TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS
- You may assume I understand Python with minimal explanation
- You may assume I understand relational data modelling, SQL, and normalisation deeply
- You may assume I understand Tailwind CSS fundamentals (class generation, compilation, etc.)
- You should assume I will *not* immediately understand JavaScript UI code without explanation

### STYLE & DESIGN GUIDANCE
- Treat me as non-professional in UI/UX design
- Explain design decisions clearly and concretely
- I welcome suggestions for better UI patterns, tools, or approaches
- If you see a simpler, more maintainable, or more idiomatic solution—especially for UI—suggest it

### ENGINEERING STANDARDS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- High technical standards are mandatory
- Avoid:
  - inefficient or unnecessarily complex code
  - duplicated logic
  - non-normalised data models
  - inconsistent patterns
- Consistency is critical and must be preserved across:
  - coding standards (naming, formatting, structure)
  - comments and documentation style
  - file and folder layout
  - architectural patterns

### PROJECT INTENT
- I am committed to continually improving and refining this project
- All instructions I give are in service of correctness, clarity, maintainability, and quality
- If something conflicts with these goals, stop and raise the issue explicitly

### PROCESS EXPECTATION
- Before making changes, inspect the existing code and structure
- Do not invent files, folders, or abstractions
- Prefer small, reviewable changes
- Explain what you changed and why
- NEVER assume, NEVER pretend you know something if you don't and ALWAYS ask for clarification
